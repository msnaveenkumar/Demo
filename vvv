Collaboration with Abhishek – Process Improvement Opportunity
A similar discussion took place with Abhishek, where I was given the opportunity to contribute toward process improvements.

Specifically, I implemented an improved Page Object Model (POM) structure for Cypress, aimed at enhancing maintainability and scalability.

I also took ownership of suggested changes related to a production issue, which stemmed from capability maturity gaps in the existing framework.

These improvements have helped streamline the automation process and strengthen the framework’s stability.
