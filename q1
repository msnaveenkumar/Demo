Key Assumptions and Calculations:

Each automation execution saves 120 minutes (2 hours).
The automation is performed 5 days a week, totaling approximately 260 days per year.
Total effort saved annually: 2 hours * 260 days = 520 hours.
Assuming an average labor rate of $X/hour (please insert your actual rate).
Total monetary savings per year: 520 hours * $X = $Y.

Investment:

If the investment or cost of automation is, for example, $5,000, then:
ROI= 
Investment
Savings−Investment
​
 ×100
ROI= 
$5,000
$Y−$5,000
​
 ×100
