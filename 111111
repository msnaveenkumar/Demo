Hi Hiten,

Thank you for your thoughtful feedback and for taking the time to review the SDH automation update.

I truly appreciate your candid input and your focus on clarity and impact — it helps ensure our efforts stay aligned with what matters most.

As requested, here’s a concise summary of the ROI from our automation efforts:

ROI Summary – SDH Automation
Manual Effort Previously: 139 minutes/week

Effort with Automation: 19 minutes/week

Effort Saved: 120 minutes/week

ROI: ~86.3%

This means automation is reducing manual effort by over 86%, translating into significant time savings and improved efficiency. We’re already seeing strong results, and we expect these gains to grow further as more features are automated.

I’ll continue to keep future updates focused and to the point. Please let me know if you'd like a visual summary or a deeper dive into any specific area.

Thanks again for your continued support!

Best regards,
Naveen
