Subject: Re: Request for Project Release

Hi Subhransu,

Thank you for your email and for clearly articulating your concerns.

I acknowledge the points you've raised regarding workload challenges and the discussions held previously. Your contributions to the SDH project have been valuable, and I believe we can work together to find a suitable path forward.

Letâ€™s set up a discussion tomorrow to review the current situation in detail and explore possible solutions, including workload management and support options. I believe this conversation will help us align expectations and address your concerns effectively without proceeding with a release at this stage.

Meeting invite will follow shortly.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
