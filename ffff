Hi Hiten,

Thank you for providing the detailed data on the automation initiative. Based on the information, I have calculated the potential ROI for executing the automation over one year.

Key Assumptions and Calculations:

Each automation execution saves 120 minutes (2 hours).
The automation is performed 5 days a week, totaling approximately 260 days per year.
Total effort saved annually: 2 hours * 260 days = 520 hours.
Assuming an average labor rate of $X/hour (please insert your actual rate).
Total monetary savings per year: 520 hours * $X = $Y.
Investment:

The total investment or cost of automation is $Y (please specify).
ROI Calculation:

ROI= 
Investment
Savings−Investment
​
 ×100
ROI= 
$Y
$Y−$Y
​
 ×100=0%
(Note: Please replace both the savings and investment with actual values to get a meaningful ROI.)

Please replace $X with your actual labor rate per hour and specify the precise investment cost to determine the exact ROI.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further or need any additional insights.
