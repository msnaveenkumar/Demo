Hi Team,

After evaluating both POJO-based deserialization and JsonPath-based dynamic manipulation approaches for handling complex JSON payloads in our test automation framework, I recommend moving forward with JsonPath for the following reasons:

✅ Use Case Summary
Deeply nested JSON with arrays/objects (e.g., datasets → datasetElements → reportAttributes)
Partial and dynamic updates (e.g., names, catalog IDs)
Used primarily in POST operations in automation
Requires response validation for updated fields
🔍 Comparison Table
Feature / Criteria	POJO (Plain Old Java Object)	JsonPath
🔁 Partial field updates	❌ Difficult – full object mapping	✅ Easy – update via path
🧱 Boilerplate code	❌ High – many Java classes	✅ None – work with raw JSON
⚡ Dynamic data injection	❌ Limited	✅ Highly flexible
🧪 Test automation efficiency	❌ Slower setup	✅ Fast and reusable
🔍 Read/Assert specific values	❌ Verbose	✅ One-liner with JsonPath
🔄 Post-operation (JSON as payload)	✅ Good for full objects	✅ Best for templates/partials
🔧 Schema/type safety	✅ Compile-time safety	❌ Runtime only
✅ Why JsonPath is the Better Fit
We're not building domain models, just modifying JSON for tests.
POJOs add complexity for deeply nested structures.
JsonPath enables fast, flexible, low-code manipulation.
🔚 Conclusion
For our use case — automation testing with dynamic updates to JSON payloads and partial response validation — JsonPath offers greater flexibility, lower overhead, and faster development compared to POJOs.

Please let me know if you'd like a sample project template or code walkthrough.
