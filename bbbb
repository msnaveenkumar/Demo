Based on our ROI calculation, the weekly manual effort is approximately 139 minutes, and automation is saving about 120 minutes each week. Using the ROI formula, we have:

ROI = (Manual Effort / Effort Saved) × 100 = (139 / 120) × 100 ≈ 86.33%

This means that our automation efforts are reducing manual effort by over 86%, reflecting a substantial efficiency gain and a high return on investment.
